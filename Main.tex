\part[5][1][1]
Assuming ideal opamp, determine the transfer function of KHN biquad high pass filter. Design a KHN circuit to realize a high pass function with $f_{o}=10 KHz$ and $Q = 2$, assume the integrators have same resistors and capacitors, with $C=1nF$. What is the value of high frequency gain obtained? What is the centre frequency gain of bandpass function that is simultaneously available at the output of the first integrator?
